# String Encryption
An encryption program that takes input as a string and returns an encrypted integer array.

## How it works
When the program is run the main GUI will appear. In the main GUI the user will have the option to choose between encryption and decryption. The user will decide by clicking on either the "Encrypt" or the "Decrypt" button after entering the required messages. 

The required messages are either the message you wish to encrypt or a previously encrypted message that the user wishes to decrypt.

After the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button has been clicked a new GUI screen will appear. On this screen will be a blank text area as well as a button. After clicking the "Show" button the encrypted or decrypted message will appear in the previously blank text area.
